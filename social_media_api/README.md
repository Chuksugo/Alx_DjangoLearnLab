User Registration and Authentication
Register: Users can register by providing a username, password, and email.
Login: Users can log in to obtain an authentication token.
Authentication: Use the token in the Authorization header to access protected endpoints.
User Model Overview
The project includes a custom user model with the following fields:

Profile Picture: An image field for the user's profile picture.
Bio: A short bio or description of the user.
Followers: A ManyToMany field for user follow relationships.
This custom user model extends Django's built-in user model to support additional attributes and features for better profile management.



======


 Enhance the CustomUser model to support user follow relationships and feed functionality.

Model Updates:

Added Fields:
followers: A ManyToManyField representing users who follow the current user, with a related_name='followed_by'.
following: A ManyToManyField representing users the current user is following, with a related_name='following_users'.
Migration:

Run the following commands to update the database schema:
bash
Copy code
python manage.py makemigrations accounts
python manage.py migrate
Functionality:

Follow/Unfollow: Users can follow or unfollow other users, creating a bidirectional relationship.
Accessing Relationships:
user1.following.add(user2) to follow another user.
user1.following.remove(user2) to unfollow.
user2.followed_by.all() to see who follows user2.
user1.following_users.all() to see whom user1 is following.
Future Considerations:

Ensure consistency in relationship handling.
Use descriptive related_name attributes for readability.
Consider edge case handling, such as preventing self-following or duplicate entries.
These updates provide the foundation for user interactions related to following, unfollowing, and generating feeds based on usersâ€™ follow relationships.
